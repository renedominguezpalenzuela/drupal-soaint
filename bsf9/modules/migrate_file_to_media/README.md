# Migrate File Entities to Media Entities

This module allows you to migrate Drupal 8.0 file entities to Drupal 8.5 media entities using the migrate module.
Lately, also support for Drupal 7 entities was added.

## Main features

- While migrating the files, a binary hash of all images is calculated and duplicate files are recognized. If the same file was uploaded multiple times, only one media entity will be created.
- Migration of translated file/image fields is supported. Having different images per language will create a translated media entity with the corresponding image.
- Using migrate module allows drush processing, rollback and track changes.

## Usage

- Install the module.

## Preparation: Install media core module

Before you can start, you need to install the media module of Drupal Core. This will automatically create 4 (in Drupal 8.5) or 5 (in Drupal 8.6) media bundle types for you, namely image, video, file and audio.

## Generate the target media fields

- Generate the media fields based on the existing file fields using the following drush command:

```
drush migrate:file-media-fields <entity_type> <bundle> <source_field_type> <target_media_bundle>
```

### Example

```
drush migrate:file-media-fields node article image image
```

For all file fields the corresponding media entity reference fields will be automatically created suffixed by <field_name>_media.

## Create a custom the migration per content type based on the migrate_file_to_media_example module

- Create a custom module
- Create your custom migration templates using the included yml generator.
- The module supports nodes and also paragraphs and any other entity type as a source bundle.

```
drush generate yml-migrate_file_to_media_migration_media
```
```
Welcome to yml-migrate_file_to_media_migration_media generator!
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
 Module machine name:
  ➤ migrate_file_to_media_example
```

The generator will ask you several questions about the module, the source bundle and the target media entity.
It will generate several files based on your answers, that can be used to migrate the files to media entity.

## Refresh / check migrations
If you created a new module with the generator, you can just enable the module and the migrations will be visible when running `drush ms`.
If you generated the migration files into an existing module, you will have to install the module `config_devel` and update your info.yml file.
You can find a nice documentation about config_devel here: https://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/191435/how-to-refresh-new-migrations-in-drupal-8-migration-module/200756#200756

## Prepare duplicate file detection

In order to detect duplicate files / images, run the following drush command to calculate a binary hash 
for all files. The data will be saved to the table "migrate_file_to_media_mapping". **You need to run this 
drush command before you can import media entities.**

Run the duplicate file detection for step 1 of your file migration:

```
drush migrate:duplicate-file-detection <migration_name>
```

## (optional step): Check for existing medias
Sometimes you already have media entities in your database or you have multiple migrations and would like to 
avoid duplicate media entities. Here is the solution:
1. Run the command `drush migrate:duplicate-media-detection image --all`. (see `drush help migrate:duplicate-media-detection` for extra options)
2. Run the duplicate file detection for step 1 of your file migration: `drush migrate:duplicate-file-detection <migration_name> --check-existing-media`
3. Run step 1 and 2 of your file migrations as described on the project page or the readme.

## Migrate the images to media entities

### Check the migrations using
```
drush migrate:status
```
### Run the migrations using
```
drush migrate:import <migration_name>
```

## Explanation of the generated migration files

### Step 1:
File `config/install/migrate_plus.migration.migrate_file_to_media_example_article_images_step1.yml`

This is the starting point. This migration creates a unique media entity from all files / images referenced by 
fields in the configuration `field_names` of the source plugin.
In the example, we have two image fields called: "field_image" and "field_image2".

#### Important:

The drush command to calculate the binary hash need to be run before you can use the
media_entity_generator source plugin.

### Using rokka.io on Step 1:

File `config/install/migrate_plus.migration.migrate_file_to_media_example_article_images_step1_rokka.yml`

This is an example migration, how to move all images to the rokka.io image cdn. You need to install the
drupal rokka module.

### Step 2:

File `config/install/migrate_plus.migration.migrate_file_to_media_example_article_images_step1_de.yml`

This migration adds a translation to existing media entities if a translated file / image field is found.

### Step 3:

File `config/install/migrate_plus.migration.migrate_file_to_media_example_article_images_step2.yml`

This migration links the newly created media entities with entity reference field on the target bundle.


## Drupal 7 File to Media migrations
Check the folder migrate_file_to_media_d7_d8 for a documentation, how to use this module to migrate D7 files to D8 medias.
